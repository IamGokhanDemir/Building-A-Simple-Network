# Building-A-Simple-Network
# My project is about creating a basic computer network using Cisco Packet Tracer. It helps connect three computers together so they can communicate with each other. I did this project to learn how computer networks work and how to set them up. 
# It's important because networks allow computers to share information and resources, which is useful in businesses and organizations.
# I completed this project in May 2023 as part of a learning exercise or as a challenge.
#I used Cisco Packet Tracer, a software that simulates network environments, to connect the computers with a switch. Then, I configured each computer with an IP address and subnet mask to enable communication between them.
# I am a student interested in networking, cybersecurity and computer technology. I worked on this project individually as a way to enhance my skills and understanding of networks.
